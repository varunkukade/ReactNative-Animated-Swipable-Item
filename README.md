# Animated Swipable Item - Reusable component

This repository demonstrates a code to create a reusable code for the Animated Swipable Item from scratch.

	â€¢ Built on bare react native project.
	â€¢ Utilized react-native-gesture-handler and react-native-reanimated v3.
	â€¢ Once you understand the core logic, you can customize it as per your requirements.
	â€¢ You can utilize the logic even if the future library and React native versions change.
